# Week 2 Assignment: Instacart Queries

This week's assignment is to use your knowledge of SQL and our internal too, [Blazer](https://blazer.instacart.com/), to write some queries on Instacart data.

Write a query for each of the following things. Use Blazer to write and test your queries and submit your answers by creating a file in the `submissions` directory that contains the query you wrote. Please name your file `firstname-lastname.md`.

Some tables you might use are:
- users
- orders
- order_deliveries

1) Find your user ( the user who's email is your instacart.com email address )

2) Count the number of orders made by Dave's account ( user id: 22438411 )

3) Find the most recent order where the total is greater than $500

4) Count the number of deliveries ( table name: order_deliveries ) from The Garden ( warehouse id: 1000 ) that have been completed in last day

5) List the first name, last name, email, and phone number of the first 10 people to have a delivery from The Garden ( warehouse id: 1000 )


**fun fact**: Blazer is open source software that was developed by one of our early engineers. It is used at Instacart and by many other people. You can look at the source code for Blazer [here](https://github.com/ankane/blazer).
